# A comment, this is so you can read your programs later.
# Anything after this octothorpe is ignored by python, just like in Ruby

print "I could have code like this" # and this is just a comment

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run"

print "This will run."
